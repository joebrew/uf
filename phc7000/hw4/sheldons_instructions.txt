Hey everyone,
 
I hope everyone is having a stress-free night.
For seminar next week, I want to try make it a little bit more interactive. So In order to facilitate this, I have attached two chapters of reading from the book "Clinical Research Methods", by Hulley and Cummings which actually gives a really good summary of how to start thinking about what goes into a sample size calculation.
 
I have also attached a word document with three questions that summarize the basics of sample size determination.
 
In addition to this, please take a look at the following links that will serve as a supplement to the book chapters.
 
A link to Hully and Cummings main website that has a sample size calculator

Another Link to Hully and Cummings course website with additional information

A lecture on the subject (about one hour)

If you all have any more questions, please let me know.
If not, I’ll see you all next week!
