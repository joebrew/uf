  <p class="regulartext">The overall goal of the NIH
    Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly
    trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the Nation's biomedical, behavioral, and
    clinical research needs. &nbsp;More
    information about NRSA programs may be found at the <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=41125">Ruth L. Kirschstein
    National Research Service Award (NRSA)</a> website.<br>
    <br>
    The purpose of the predoctoral fellowship (F31) award is to
    provide support for promising doctoral candidates who will be performing
    dissertation research and training in scientific health-related fields relevant
    to the missions of the participating NIH Institutes during the tenure of the
    award. The Kirschstein-NRSA for Individual Predoctoral Fellows will provide up
    to five years of support for research training which leads to the PhD or
    equivalent research degree, the combined MD/PhD degree, or another formally
    combined professional degree and research doctoral degree in the biomedical,
    behavioral, or clinical sciences.</p>
  <p class="regulartext">Applicants for the Kirschstein-NRSA F31 award must propose a
    dissertation research project and training program that fall in a research area
    within the scientific mission of the participating Institutes. The proposed
    predoctoral research training must offer an opportunity to enhance the fellow's
    understanding of the health-related sciences and extend his/her potential for a
    productive, independent research career. The training should provide the
    applicant with the opportunity to interact with members of the scientific
    community at appropriate scientific meetings and workshops (including
    NIH-sponsored meetings, where available). The application should document the
    need for the proposed research training and the expected value of the proposed
    fellowship experience as it relates to the individual’s goals for a career as
    an independent researcher.</p>
  <p class="regulartext"><b>Special Note:</b> Applicants are cautioned that not all
    NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) participate in this program, and that consultation
    with relevant IC staff prior to submission of an application is strongly
    encouraged. The participating ICs have different emphases and program

    not give separate scores for these items.</p>
  <p class="Heading4Indent">Protections for Human Subjects</p>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">For research that involves human subjects but does
    not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR
    Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human
    subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their
    participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to
    subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the
    subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data
    and safety monitoring for clinical trials.<br>
    <br>
    For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or
    more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the
    committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human
    subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional
    information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/peer/guidelines_general/Human_Subjects_Protection_and_Inclusion.pdf">Human
    Subjects Protection and Inclusion Guidelines</a>.</p>

  <p class="P_SingleIndent">The committee will evaluate the involvement of live
    vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the
    following five points: 1) proposed use of the animals, and species, strains,
    ages, sex, and numbers to be used; 2) justifications for the use of animals and
    for the appropriateness of the species and numbers proposed; 3) adequacy of
    veterinary care; 4) procedures for limiting discomfort, distress, pain and
    injury to that which is unavoidable in the conduct of scientifically sound
    research including the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs
    and/or comfortable restraining devices; and 5) methods of euthanasia and reason
    for selection if not consistent with the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia. For
    additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please

  <p class="P_SingleIndent">For Resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the
    application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to
    comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the
    project.</p>
  <p class="Heading4Indent">Renewals</p>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">For Renewals, the committee will consider the
    progress made in the last funding period. </p>
  <p class="Heading4Indent">Revisions</p>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">Not Allowed.</p>
  <div class="heading4">Additional Review Considerations</div>
  <p class="regulartext">As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will
    consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items,
    and should not consider them in providing an overall impact/priority score.</p>
  <p class="Heading4Indent">Training in the Responsible Conduct
    of Research </p>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">Taking into account the circumstances of the fellow,
    including level of experience, the reviewers will address the following
    questions.&nbsp; Does the plan satisfactorily address the format of instruction,
    e.g. lectures, coursework, and/or real-time discussion groups?&nbsp; Do plans
    include a sufficiently broad selection of subject matter, such as conflict of
    interest, authorship, data management, human subjects and animal use,
    laboratory safety? Do the plans adequately describe the role of the
    sponsor/mentor or other faculty involvement in the fellow’s instruction?&nbsp; Does
    the plan meet the minimum requirements for RCR, i.e., eight contact hours of
    instruction every four years?&nbsp; Plans and past record will be rated as <b>ACCEPTABLE</b> or <b>UNACCEPTABLE</b>, and the summary statement will provide the consensus of
    the review committee. See also: <a href="http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-10-019.html">NOT-OD-10-019</a>.</p>
