This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Set working directory:
```{r}
if ( Sys.info()["sysname"] == "Linux" ){
  setwd("/home/joebrew/")
} else {
  setwd("C:/Users/BrewJR/")
}

mywd <- paste0(getwd(), "/Documents/uf/phc6194/hw5")
setwd(mywd)
```

Read in the mdb file using the Hmsic library and mdb-tools.
```{r}
# Attach the necessary package
library(Hmisc)

# View which tables are available
mdb.get("Homwork5.mdb", tables = TRUE)

# Read in the Family_address table
x <- mdb.get("Homwork5.mdb", tables = "Family_address")
x <- mdb.get("Homwork5.mdb", tables = "GDB_Items")
x <- mdb.get("Homwork5.mdb", tables = "road")

library(rgdal)
road <- readOGR(".", "road")
ems <- readOGR(".", "EMS_LOCATION")
fam <- readOGR(".", "Family_address")

plot(road)
points(ems, col = "red", pch = 16)
points(fam, col = "blue", pch = 16)
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
